1. The praise songs of a nation
flowed from his hand
And in a world of dark oppression 
he made a stand.
They told him to be silent, 
and led him away
Ten years was the sentence, 
a pris'ner of faith.

As he waited for God's timing 
another winter chilled the air
And when he thought of his own fam'ly he was filled with despair.
So he cried out for justice, 
was there any other way...
Then he gave it all to Jesus, 
as he began to pray:

R: Break my plans, Shape my heart, 
Take my will to where You are.
Move my mind through Your Word
'till all that I am lives to love You, Lord!

2. I know I'm called to suffer 
and to take up my cross
But some times I grow so fearful 
when I count the cost
Still my hearts wants to follow,
and walk in Your way,
To be counted with the faithful,
Lord, guide me today!

R: Break my plans, Shape my heart, 
Take my will to where You are.
Move my mind through Your Word
'till all that I am lives to love You, Lord!

B: With all of my heart,
my strength and my soul
I will love You, God... 
So use my life 
and take complete control!

R: Break my plans, Shape my heart, 
Take my will to where You are.
Move my mind through Your Word
'till all that I am lives to love You, Lord!
